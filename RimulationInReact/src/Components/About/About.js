              going through a central authority. we Building a transprent and
              trustless system in which user can indulge themselves directly in
              the process of land exchange from anywhere in the world between

              the end users involved to switch their roles according to the
              situation. (ie) virtual connector can only be a virtual connector
              likewise a owner can only be an owner.

              A pure version of electronic geo NFT(non-fungible tokens tokens
              (Georim) would allow online transfer of ownership to be sent
              directly from one party to another without going through a central
              authority. Georim Tokens are provided as part of the solution
              where these tokens can be bought at an auction or with a native
              coin (Rimule or RILE) or swapped with other Georims for relative
              values. We propose a solution by linking the earthâ€™s area to
              Georim using geo coordinates. A Georim contains an area in sq.
              feet with respect to satellite maps; this will eventually lead to
              a technology called Rimulation (Real-World Simulation).
